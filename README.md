## Challenge Overview
We participated in **MIT iQuHACK 2025** and tackled the **IonQ challenge**, which focused on solving a **Max-Cut problem** by using the varQITE algorithm. The challenge consisted of three tasks:
1. Standard Max-Cut problem.
2. Ensuring both sets are balanced in size.
3. Ensuring that each of the subgraphs within each of the two sets are connected.
